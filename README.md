# Advent of Code 2020

Goals for this year:
- Create some visualizations
- Try to find alternatives to `std::regex`ing all the things
- Try to stream data to the solutions as much as possible
- Run hard at graph traversal, not away from..
- Most importantly have fun and don't lose too much sleep trying to get solutions done before going to bed!
